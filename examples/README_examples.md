## Examples
Two tutorials are provided as a knitted Notebook, a document format that
combines computer code, descriptions, and visualizations all in one
page. This makes it easy to develop, share, and reproduce code. 

The first tutorial (`low-carbon-london_1.pdf`) uses a very small sample of
the Low Carbon London trials (1 household), and is intended to be a quick,
simple tutorial for those in a hurry. 

The second tutorial (`low-carbon-london_2.pdf`) uses the full data set (~ 11 GB)
and is more comprehensive and will take much longer to complete. 

<!-- For those of you planning on using a text editor to open/run
the [R notebook][R-nb]: --> <!-- ```{r} --> <!-- ## Save your .Rmd file (R
Notebook) in a directory of your choice. Then run the following: --> <!--
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ukdataservice/SMRP/master/scripts/utils.R")
--> <!-- check_pkgs("rmarkdown") -->

<!-- ## This command will produce either an .html or .pdf file in your current working directory. -->
<!-- ## The output format depend on the output format defined in the header of the .Rmd file. -->
<!-- rmarkdown::render("path/to/Rnotebook.Rmd")                 # Edit the path as appropriate. -->
<!-- ``` -->
